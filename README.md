# Teensy-3.6-AUDIO-Protoboard
PCB and Panel gerbers for building an audio/synth/DSP exploratory interface based on Teensy 3.6 

Specifications:  
- Nine pots for analog reading: A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, A18, A19, A20  
- Five push buttons for digital reading: D24, D25, D26, D27, D28  
- One rotary switch: D3 (CLK), D4 (DT), D5 (SW)  
- Two Trigger/Gate inputs: D29 and D30  
- MIDI IN and MIDI OUT. Two panel versions: vs1 for 5DIN MIDI and vs2 for TRS MIDI (3.5 mm stereo jacks have to be wired to the PCB in that case)  
- Audio IN and OUT. Can also be used with the audio adaptor board (https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html); in that case use the Teensy 3.6 SD card slot, not that of the audio board
- ILI9341 320x240 2.8 TFT XPT2046 TOUCHSCREEN
